Robot Framework test library API examples
=========================================

`Robot Framework <http://robotframework.org>`_ is a generic open source test
automation framework. It has easy-to-use tabular test data syntax and it
utilizes the keyword-driven testing approach. Its testing capabilities can be
extended by test libraries implemented either with Python or Java.

This project contains executable examples demonstrating different features
of Robot Framework test library API. The API itself is documented thoroughly
in `Robot Framework User Guide <http://robotframework.org/robotframework>`_.

**Work in progress.**
